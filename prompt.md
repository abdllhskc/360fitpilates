Create a creative, award-winning frontend design for "360 fit Pilates".

Concept: Everything revolves around the circle (360).
Tech Stack: React, Tailwind, Framer Motion, and Spline (or Three.js fiber) for 3D elements.

Key Features:
1. Interactive Cursor: A custom circular cursor that expands when hovering over clickable elements.
2. Hero Section: Instead of a video, place a large, interactive 3D 360-degree ring or sphere in the center that reacts to mouse movement. Title: "360 fit Pilates".
3. Scroll Interactions: As the user scrolls, the background color should smoothly transition between Cream (#F9F7F1) and Sage Green (#8FBC8F).
4. Typography: Use huge, oversized typography for section headers (e.g., "FLOW", "POWER") that moves horizontally (marquee effect) as the user scrolls down.
5. Service Cards: Minimalist cards with thin borders. When hovered, they should fill with color (Terracotta).

Make it look like a futuristic wellness center. High performance and smooth animations are priority.
